### E-Mail

If you want to get the offers by email, you can use free services like [Blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/) or [Feedsub](https://feedsub.com/) to convert from RSS to email.

### Discord

Prefer to get the offers in a Discord channel?
You can use the free [MonitoRSS](https://monitorss.xyz/) bot to post them there for you.
I suggest the following settings:

- **Feed URL**: Use the RSS feed links above
- **Content**:

    ```md
    **{{title}}**

    {{description}}
    ```

- **Button**: Label: `Claim`, URL: `{{link}}`
- **Embed**: Just select `Image URL` with the `{{extracted::atom:content__#::image1}}` variable

## Automatically Claim Free Games

Now that you get notified about all the free games, you might want to make the process of claiming them even easier.
For this, I created some [userscripts](https://eikowagenknecht.com/posts/userscripts-to-claim-free-games/) that can be used with Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey / Violentmonkey.
