# TODO

Temporarily, this file will be used to keep track of the tasks that need to be done.
This will be replaced by GitHub issues again once this is migrated into the main repository.

## Tasks

- [ ] Migrate this file to the main repository
- [ ] Update README_DEV.md
- [ ] Update README.md
- [ ] Run xvfb in Docker only if needed (see <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xvfb>) for an outdated example)
- [ ] Check the rest of the Python files for code that needs to be migrated
- [ ] Simplify the utils/ folder
