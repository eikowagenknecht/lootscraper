# TODO

Temporarily, this file will be used to keep track of the tasks that need to be done.
This will be replaced by GitHub issues again once this is migrated into the main repository.

## Optional

- Add auto generated semantic release notes back in

## Performance improvements

- Run xvfb in Docker only if needed (see <https://www.npmjs.com/package/xvfb> for an outdated example) (see main.py)
